# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
 npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network goerli
 npx hardhat verify 0x174136d234a73B32D25a2A42860DFe4fF748Ee79 --network goerli
```
